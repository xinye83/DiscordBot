# DiscordBot
 
A discord bot written in Python.

Files not version controlled but are necessary for the bot to run:
- `.env` contains all environment variables for the bot.
    - `token`: discord bot token
- `apikey.txt`: Blizzard API key which SimulationCraft will be using to pull character information from WoW Armory
